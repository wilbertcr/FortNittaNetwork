# FortNittaNetwork

FortNitta is a game created as a part of ECS 160: Software Engineering, Computer Science Department, UC Davis, Fall Quarter 2015, taught by Professor Christopher Nitta. FortNitta is a game inspired by Rampart. In the course of the class several functional groups were formed, tasked with developing the original Linux game, as well as ports to Windows, OSX, iOS, and Android.

My team was tasked with creating the Networking API for the game in the different platforms the game was implemented, as well as the Server all platforms would be talking to. I played a crucial role in the architecture and implementation of the Linux, Windows and Android Client Networking API for the game.

Due to license restrictions, I am only publishing the Networking code, which I worked on directly. The files Thread.cpp/h and ThreadMutex.cpp/h under Linux-Network were provided by Professor Christopher Nitta, along with lots of advise on the architecture and implementation.

Although I wrote a good chunk of this code, I did not write it all and hence cannot share it. If you would like to use this code, please contact me and I'll ask the other members of my team for permission.
